I have 2 ssh keys for different github accounts.

I git push in a local clone directory which using id_rsa key but got permission denied error.
    ERROR: Permission to linjian/my_stuff.git denied to jianlin@xxx.com.

    fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

I googled and find the [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5335197/gits-famous-error-permission-to-git-denied-to-user solution].

Did it as following can resolve this issue:
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_yottaa
